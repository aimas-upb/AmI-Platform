        be able to do this, message processing is broken into
        two parts:

        - heavy_preprocess(msg) - this is the actual part that will be
          parallelized. This will be executed on a multiprocess pool (so
          we can do both CPU bound and I/O bound, but at the expense of
          having to pass the heavy_preprocess function as a parameter
          because it must be picklable and thus unbound).

        - light_postprocess(msg) - this is the actual part that will executed
          sequentially - after each heavy processing is done in parallel,
          this processing will be done in serial.

        This kind of PDU also has 2 configuration options:

            ORDERED_DELIVERY = True/False => light_postprocess will be executed
                    in the same order as the messages coming into the PDU.
                    This means a lower throughput (because the thread pool
                    might finish messages which came in later early) at the
                    expense of ordered delivery when it's needed.

            POOL_SIZE = N (default 4). The size of the pool. Usually it's
                    recommended in operating system literature to set this
