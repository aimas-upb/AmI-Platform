        ###
            A graceful way to preload the app widgets, having a "loading"
            screen that waits until widgets are being loaded in the back,
            thus assuming that the widgets are not to be shown while loading
            TODO: Should ignore widgets that have own loading states, they
            don't need a global screen to cater for them

            It subscribes to the /new_widget and /new_widget_rendered pubsub
            channels, in order to track each created and rendered widget,
            respectively.

            On an interval of LOADING_FINISHED_CHECK_INTERVAL, it repeatedly
            checks what's the current loading progress of the entire app, based
            on a (highly) estimative logic:
                - With each interval iteration, the list of widgets that have
                been triggered as created, but not yet rendered, are collected.
                They are called "nasty widgets"
                - Whenever an interation happens with zero nasty widgets, it is
                considered a "success round"
                - We expect MAX_SUCCESS_RENDER_ROUNDS **consecutive** success
                rounds to happen before considering the app loaded and hiding
                the loading animation. This translates to: we keep the loading
                animation visible until at some point in time no widgets are
                pending to load for a LOADING_FINISHED_CHECK_INTERVAL *
                MAX_SUCCESS_RENDER_ROUNDS period of time (half a second with
                the current configuration)
                - In contrast, if a round with nasty widgets happens after
                more than REPORT_NASTY_WIDGETS_INTERVAL seconds of total
                loading, the current nasty widgets will be reported using error
                logging, and in production the loading animation will be
                forcibly removed. The last part translates to: The loading
                animation can't take more than REPORT_NASTY_WIDGETS_INTERVAL
                seconds in production (25 seconds in current configuration)

            The formula for displaying the loading progress is just as
            unpredictible:
                - It estimates that 99% of the loading will take
                INTERVAL_FOR_99_PERCENT seconds (6 seconds in current
                configuration). So it loads linearly up to this point
                - If it takes more than INTERVAL_FOR_99_PERCENT seconds, it
                will be locked at 99% until the previous logic considers the
                app to be loaded
                - If the loading is flagged as done before
                INTERVAL_FOR_99_PERCENT seconds have passed, the progress bar
                is accelerated to 100% in order to feel natural (even though
                the app is ready at this point). This fake loading compensation
                can only take up to ACCELERATED_FINISH seconds, though (0.2
                seconds in the current configuration)

                This callback is performed whenever a new widget has appeared
                in the system. Widgets are initialized by the widget starter
                whenever all their channels have been initialized, and after
                they have been injected into the DOM.

                We store both the widget ID and a mapping from ID to name
                to use later without needing to break encapsulation and
                hack into loader's internal structures to get the widget name.

                This callback is performed whenever a widget is rendered for
                the first time. Widgets publish this kind of event automatically
                when they do renderLayout() for the first time. The single
                exception to this are widgets without a template_name, who
                are considered "container" widgets whose sole role is to
                insert other widgets into the DOM.
