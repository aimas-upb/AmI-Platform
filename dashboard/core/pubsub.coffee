            Communication backbone between the Mozaic components.

            Basically, the main Mozaic components such as datasource,
            widgets and controllers are completely decoupled and communicate
            through a pub-sub model.

            This contains a breakage of a component to a part of the system.

            ###
                Bind one or more space separated events, `events`, to a
                `callback` function. Passing `"all"` will bind the callback
                to all events fired.

                Publish one or many events, firing all bound callbacks.
                Callbacks are passed the same arguments as 'publish' is, apart
                from the event name (unless you're listening on 'all', which
                will cause your callback to receive the true name of the event
                as the first argument).
