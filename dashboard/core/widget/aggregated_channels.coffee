            This class contains all aggregated-channels
            related functionality of the Mozaic widget.

        _getSubscribedChannels: ->
            ###
                Gets the data channels to which this widget is subscribed.

                This performs token replacement in channels data with parameters
                received at the widget initialization. For example, if widget
                has been initialized with id = 123 in its parameters, and there
                is a data channel "mention/{{id}}", this will return "mention/123".

                The params are received from the HTML when the widget is instantiated.

        aggregateChannels: (callback, channels) ->
            ###
                Triggers callback whenever all channels have data

                This is similar to Promise.all() from the Promise.js framework.
                For example, if we wish the "render" method to be called whenever
                both "/mentions/123" and "/tags" data have arrived, we would use it
                like this:

                aggregateChannels(@render, ['/mentions/123', '/tags'])

                This call will trigger the 'render' member function whenever there
                is data for both the given mention and tags. THIS CREATES THE EVENT
                HANDLERS FOR EACH CHANNEL IF THEY DON'T EXIST, OR WRAPS THE EXISTING
                ONES OTHERWISE.

                After the first time data is available for all channels, this will
                trigger the callback each time there is data on any of the channels.

                Since this waits for *all* channels to get data, the following
                situations might happen:
                    - data for one of the channels never comes, and this
                        never gets executed
                    - data for a channel comes multiple times (for example,
                        the mention might be updated multiple times while waiting
                        for the tags to arrive). In this case, the callback
                        gets as parameters the last set of parameters for each
                        of the channels callbacks
