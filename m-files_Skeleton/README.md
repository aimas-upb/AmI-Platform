csvimport 	= reads from csv text files

read_skel 	= displays 2D skeleton from Kinect SDK

DrawSkeleton 	= displays 3D data from 15 joints see link: http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/humanactivities/data.php

For "filtering-out" bad examples (for training / testing purposes) a  filtering script (filter_export) was used:

https://github.com/ami-lab/AmI-Platform/blob/master/filter_export.py
 
 this one uses a "master-file" which gives the indexes of good skeletons (obtained after a visual inspection) or after a "pre-filtering" 
 
based  on skeleton-resemblance (entropy) with the following syntax:
  
python filter_export.py -f filters.txt -i CSV -o CSV-filtrate
  
where:
  
filters.txt (it's the  "master file" of indexes to be retained)
  
CSV is the origin folder (where all the .csv skeleton files are kept before filtering) 
  
CSV-filtrate is the destination folder (where all the .csv skeleton files that are kept after filtering are to be written) 

PS: this latter folder (CSV-filtrate) is created automatically by filter_export.py if doesn't exist a-priori)
 
Features_Compute returns the angle between 3 3D points (of the skeleton)

Line_to_Plane_Angle returns the angle between a line determined by 2 3D skeleton-points and a plane, either yOz or xOy

Finally, getParams.m returns a cell-array of 22 features (mainly angles for upper-body part) to be used in classification (estimation) of subject's body pose.

P.S. All these  scripts for feature detection are just for academic purpose and to generate HTML 
documentation (using m2html); in the end they should be replaced asap with corresponding Python (C++) implementations
