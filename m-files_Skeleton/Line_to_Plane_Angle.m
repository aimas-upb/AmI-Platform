function angleInDegrees=Line_to_Plane_Angle(varargin) 
% Returns the angle between a line (given by two points)
% and a plane, (which can eventually be given by it's equation)
% varargin should provide at most 3 arguments:
%               - 3D coordinates of the 1st and 2nd point
%               - equation of the plane or the TYPE of the plane, which is: 
%                   '1' for yOz,'2' for 'xOy'

    %% The Plane considered in our case (from points obtained from skeletons we get from Kinect)
    %  is either 'yOz' or 'xOy' (depending on the 'type'-input: for type=1 (we compute angle with the 'yOz'-plane):
    x1=P1(1,1); y1=0; z1=0; p1=[x1, y1, z1]; % 'p1' is on the 'X'-axis (preserves  only abscissa from P1)
    x2=x1; y2=0; z2=P1(1,3); p2=[x2, y2, z2]; % 'p2' is on definitely on the xOz plane
    % Now, create a plane from the 3 points:
    plane = createPlane(P1, p1, p2); %
    %  'plane' is the plane || (parallel) to y0z that passes thru the points: P1, p2 & p1

    % Point P2 is considered linked (like 'with a bar' to P1) and so, P2 is dragged away  with P1
    % the 2nd translation brings P2 down on the x0z plane (so y2 becomes ==0);

    % 1) If we drag the line L parallel to itself until P1 point arrives on the x0y plane :
    % 2) Once it got there, we let line L' (parallel to L) 'sink' on the
    % plane x0z, i.e. until point P1' (projection of P1 onto the x0y plane)i.e. arrives on the  x axis (the abscissa); 
    % the formula of the 'original' line 'L' with the x0y follows immediately:
    l1 = sqrt((P2(1,2)-P1(1,2))^2+(P2(1,3)-P1(1,3))^2);
